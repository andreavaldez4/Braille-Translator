# Braille-Translator
Python program that translates text to braille and creates plaques that can be later used for science study models for visually impared students. 

The accessibility of inclusive resources in the educational environment is a key factor in the cognitive and social development of individuals with visual impairments, making proper signage essential. This work presents the design of a digital program with an interactive interface for automating the translation and 3D printing process of Braille signs. The program receives lines of text and outputs an STL file containing the Braille dots that form the words on a plaque, adjusted to the message's size and ready for printing.
